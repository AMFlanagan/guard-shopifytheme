{"name":"Guard Shopify Theme","tagline":"Guard gem for updating shopify through shopify_theme","body":"# Guard::Shopifytheme\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dannysmith/guard-shopifytheme.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dannysmith/guard-shopifytheme) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/guard-shopifytheme.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/guard-shopifytheme)\r\n\r\nUses [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) to watch for changes and update Shopify when a file is changed. Very similar functionality to [guard-shopify](https://github.com/1337807/guard-shopify), except that it uses the [shopify_theme](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme) gem to do most of the work. This has a couple of advantages:\r\n\r\n* shopify_theme is maintained by Shopify, so will usually be up-to-date.\r\n* The config settings are stored in the project directory (rather than in `~/.guard_shopify`, as with guatd-shopify)\r\n* If you choose to use the `theme watch` command provided by shopify_theme instead of Guard, then everything will still work properly â€“ you don't need to maintain two sets of config files.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nMake sure you have installed [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard).\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'guard-shopifytheme'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself with:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install guard-shopifytheme\r\n\r\nIf you don't already have [shopify_theme](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme) set up, create a `config.yml` file in your project directory (see [here](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme#usage)):\r\n\r\n````yaml\r\n---\r\n:api_key: YOUR_API_KEY\r\n:password: YOUR_PASSWORD\r\n:store: YOURSHOP.myshopify.com\r\n:theme_id: 'YOUR_THEME_ID'\r\n:ignore_files:\r\n- README.md\r\n- CHANGELOG.md\r\n````\r\n\r\nAdd the Guard definition to your Guardfile with:\r\n\r\n    $ guard init guard-shopifytheme\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThere aren't any options, so usage is pretty simple:\r\n\r\n````ruby\r\n# Upload Changes to Shopify\r\nguard :shopifytheme do\r\n  watch(/assets\\/.*/)\r\n  watch(/config\\/.*/)\r\n  watch(/layout\\/.*/)\r\n  watch(/snippets\\/.*/)\r\n  watch(/templates\\/.*/)\r\nend\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\n## An Alternative\r\nIf you don't want to install this gem, you can just add this to your Guardfile:\r\n\r\n````ruby\r\nrequire 'guard/plugin'\r\n\r\nmodule ::Guard\r\n  class ShopifyTheme < ::Guard::Plugin\r\n    def run_all\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def start\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def run_on_changes(paths)\r\n      paths.each do |path|\r\n        system \"theme upload #{path}\"\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def run_on_removals(paths)\r\n      paths.each do |path|\r\n        system \"theme remove #{path}\"\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n````\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n- Add some tests\r\n- Improve `start()` to ask for your shopify API details and write them to config.yml\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n- Danny Smith ([@dannysmith](http://github.com/dannysmith))\r\n- Shopfy_Theme by Shopify ([@shopify](https://github.com/Shopify))\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/dannysmith/guard-shopifytheme/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
